## Definition
LinkedList is an object that consists of a collection of nodes to encapsulate the process to manage and maintain the nodes. This collection of values is arranged in a unidirectional sequence that consists of nodes and directions.

Every node will have two responsibilities which are holding a value and holding a reference to the next node. What if the node is at the end of the list? It will return `nil` for reference.

## LinkedList Operations

### Add values to the list

1. `push`: Adds a value at the front [head-first insertion]
2. `append`: Adds a value at the end [tail-end insertion]
3. `insert(after:)`: Adds a value after a particular list node.

### Performance
|      | push     | append     | insert(after:)     | node(at:)     |
|:---:    |:---:    |---    |---    |---    |
| Time Complexity     | O(1)     | O(1)     | O(1)     | O(n)     |

### Remove values from the list

1. `pop`: Removes the value at the front of the list.
2. `removeLast`: Removes the value at the end of the list.
3. `remove(at: )`: Removes a value anywhere in the list.

### Performance
|      | pop     | removeLast     | remove(at: )    |
|:---:    |:---:    |---    |---    |
| Time Complexity     | O(1)     | O(n)     | O(1)    |

## Performance
- Constant time insertion & removal from the beginning of the list
